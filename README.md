# wyngman-js-test
Simple setup to test basic JS understanding

## How to do the tests
You'll find a set of JS files. Each of them represent 1 test.
Before you go ahead doing them ensure that you have 'Loom' installed so you can record your screen while you're solving the tests.

This is not about who solves these the fastest, but rather who comes up with the smoothest solution.

With that being said, much success and don't forget to record your screen while you're solving the tests.
