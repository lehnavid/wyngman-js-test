#1 Task - Create Dynamic Sentences
- Intro
    You’ve been given the task to create either of the following sentences:

    “He couldn’t find an SDR related staff member within your LinkedIn and figured you’d have your finger on the ‘strategic pulse’ better than anyone anyways.”

    or

    “He saw {{SDR Name}}, but figured you’d have your finger on the ‘outbound pulse’ better than anyone.”

But if either {{Is ICP}} or {{Is B2B}} is ‘false’ you just return an empty string.

- Resources
    You are provided with the following variables:
    > SDR Name: Billy Farrell
    > Is ICP
    > Is B2B

- Constraints
    > You can’t use variable declarations like “const result = XYZ”.
    > You have to solve this in 1 line of code
