/**
#3 Task - Extract Values from JSON String
- Intro
    In our daily operations we are confronted quite often with JSON strings.
    Your task is to extract the JSON strings by using a 1 line JS code.

- Resources
    JSON string: {
        “sector”: “digital marketing”,
        “serviceType”: “platform”,
        “address”: {
            “street”: “John Doe Street 1”,
            “zipCode”: 007
        }
    }

- Constraints
    > You can’t use variable declaration like “const result = XYZ”.
    > You have to solve this in 1 line of code
    > Extract the values for sector, serviceType, address.street, and address.zipCode
